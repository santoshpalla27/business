# What it is

Ink is instantly cured using UV light, allowing printing on almost any surface.

UV printing (Ultraviolet printing) is a digital direct-to-surface printing technology where special UV-curable inks are instantly hardened (cured) using ultraviolet light immediately after printing.

Unlike heat-based printing, UV printing works on almost any material and allows full-color, white, and layered effects.
