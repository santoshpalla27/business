#    Photoshop

Photoshop is a raster-based image editing tool. It works with pixels.

Common real-world uses

Photo editing & retouching (lighting, color, skin, object removal)

Graphic design (posters, banners, flyers)

Social media creatives (Instagram posts, YouTube thumbnails, ads)

Marketing assets (ad creatives, website banners)

Mockups (product previews, app screens on devices)

👉 Rule of thumb:

If it’s pixel-based and visual, Photoshop is usually the right tool.


#              Raster vs Vector (CRITICAL CONCEPT)

Raster (Photoshop)

Made of pixels
Quality depends on resolution
Enlarging causes blur / pixelation
Examples: Photos, scanned images, textures

Vector (Illustrator)

Made of paths & mathematical shapes
Infinitely scalable
No quality loss at any size

Examples: Logos, icons, illustrations   


Examples: Logos, icons, illustrations

| Tool        | Type   | Best For                |
| ----------- | ------ | ----------------------- |
| Photoshop   | Raster | Photos, ads, thumbnails |
| Illustrator | Vector | Logos, icons, branding  |

Golden rule:

Photoshop ≠ Logo design
Illustrator ≠ Photo editing

                             Image Basics (Must-Know Concepts)

🔹 Pixels & Canvas Size

Pixel = smallest unit of an image
Canvas size = width × height (e.g., 1920 × 1080 px)

Example:

Instagram post → 1080 × 1080 px
YouTube thumbnail → 1280 × 720 px

👉 Bigger canvas = more pixels = more detail (but larger file size)



🔹 Resolution (DPI / PPI)

72 DPI → Screens (web, mobile, social media)

300 DPI → Print (posters, brochures, magazines)

👉 DPI does NOT matter for screens
👉 DPI DOES matter for print

Common beginner mistake:
Using 72 DPI for print → blurry output



🔹 RGB vs CMYK

| Mode | Used For | Color Type  |
| ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| RGB  | Screens  | Light-based |
| CMYK | Printing | Ink-based   |


Screens glow → RGB

Printers use ink → CMYK

👉 Design for screen → RGB
👉 Design for print → CMYK


🔹 File Formats (When to Use What)

| Format | Best For | Key Feature |
| ------ | -------- | ----------- |
| JPEG   | Photos   | Small file size |
| PNG    | Graphics | Transparency |
| GIF    | Animation| Simple loops |
| TIFF   | Print    | High quality |
| SVG    | Vector   | Scalable |

👉 JPEG = photos (lossy)
👉 PNG = graphics (lossless

| Format   | Use Case                                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **JPG**  | Photos, web images (small size, no transparency) |
| **PNG**  | Transparency, logos, UI assets                   |
| **PSD**  | Photoshop working file (layers preserved)        |
| **TIFF** | High-quality print, publishing                   |
| **WebP** | Modern web images (smaller + good quality)       |


👉 Always keep your PSD (psd - editable file)
Exports are disposable, PSD is gold.




RAW is an unprocessed photo file directly from the camera.

It contains all the original image data.

Think of it like:

RAW = raw vegetables
JPEG = cooked food

RAW gives you full control before “cooking” the image.

What Makes RAW Special?

RAW files:

Keep more light and color data
Allow better brightness correction
Allow better shadow recovery
Have smoother color transitions

JPEG files:

Are compressed
Lose detail

Harder to fix if exposure is wrong

# 1. Composition Theory

## 1. Clear Definition

### Why it matters

- Good composition tells the viewer where to look.
- Bad composition makes the image confusing.

### How to use it

- Photography → Move subject, change angle, clean background.
- Product editing → Keep product as clear hero.
- Social media → Keep subject visible even in small screen.
- Cinematic video → Use framing to show emotion (wide = lonely, close = intense).

### Editing tips

- Crop tighter in Lightroom.
- Remove distractions in Photoshop.
- Reframe shots in Premiere/Resolve.

### Beginner mistake

- Keeping everything in the frame. Learn to remove.

### Pro tip

- Before shooting or editing, ask:
- “What is the main focus here?”
  
---------------------------------------------

## 2. Rule of Thirds

### What it is

- Divide the frame into 9 boxes.
- Place important things on the lines or where lines cross.

### Why it matters

- It makes images feel natural and dynamic instead of boring center placement.

### How to use it

- Portrait → Eyes on top line.
- Landscape → Horizon on top or bottom third.
- Product → Slightly off center looks more premium.
- Video → Subject off center adds movement feeling.

### Editing tip

- Turn on grid while cropping.

### Beginner mistake

- Forcing everything to the grid. It’s a guide, not a rule.

---------------------------------------------

## 3. Leading Lines

### What it is

- Lines that guide the viewer’s eye to the subject.

### Why it matters

- Eyes naturally follow lines.

### How to use it

- Roads, stairs, rails in photography.
- Table edges in product shots.
- Arrows or layout direction in social posts.
- Hallways or light beams in cinematic shots.

### Editing tip

- Increase contrast slightly to make lines clearer.

### Beginner mistake

- Lines leading outside the frame instead of toward subject.

---------------------------------------------

## 4. Visual Balance

### What it is

- Making the image feel stable.

### Why it matters

- If one side feels heavier, image feels uncomfortable.

### How to use it

- Symmetry for clean, powerful look.
- Asymmetry for dynamic look.
- Balance big subject with empty space.

### Editing tip

- Crop and adjust position until frame feels stable.

### Beginner mistake

- Too much empty space on one side without reason.

---------------------------------------------

## 5. Negative Space

### What it is

- The empty area around the main subject.

### Why it matters

- Makes image clean and premium.
- Luxury brands use this a lot.

### How to use it

- Leave sky or wall space around subject.
- Don’t fill every part of frame.
- Great for text placement in ads.

### Editing tip

- Blur background in Lightroom/Photoshop.
- Use gradient to darken empty areas.

### Beginner mistake

- Filling every inch of the frame.

---------------------------------------------

## 6. Depth & Layering

### What it is

- Depth means making the image feel 3D, not flat.
- Layering = foreground, middle, background.

### Why it matters

- Flat images look cheap.
- Depth makes images cinematic and professional.

### How to use it

- Photography → Add something in foreground (blurred leaves, wall edge).
- Product → Slight shadow under product creates depth.
- Social → Background blur makes subject pop.
- Cinematic → Shoot through objects for dramatic feel.

### Editing tip

- Lightroom → Use Radial Mask to blur background slightly.
- Photoshop → Add soft shadow under subject.
- Video → Use depth blur or light falloff.

### Beginner mistake

- Everything sharp and flat.

### Pro tip

- Foreground blur + sharp subject = instant cinematic look.

---------------------------------------------

## 7. Perspective

### What it is

- Perspective is the angle you shoot from.

### Why it matters

Angle changes power and emotion.

- Low angle → Powerful
- High angle → Weak or small
- Eye level → Neutral

### How to use it

- Product → Shoot from slightly above for clean look.
- Portrait → Eye level for connection.
- Cinematic → Low angle for drama, high angle for isolation.

### Editing tip

- Use transform tool to fix distorted lines.

### Beginner mistake

- Shooting everything from eye level.

### Pro tip

- Move your body, not just your camera.

---------------------------------------------

## 8. Color Theory

### What it is

- Color theory is how colors work together.

### Basic ideas

- Warm colors → Energy (red, orange, yellow)
- Cool colors → Calm (blue, green)
- Complementary colors → Opposite on color wheel (strong contrast)

### Why it matters

- Color controls emotion instantly.

### How to use it

- Product → Use brand colors.
- Social → Use 2–3 colors max.
- Cinematic → Use color grading to create mood.

### Editing tip

- Lightroom → Adjust Temperature & Color Grading panel.
- Photoshop → Use Selective Color or Gradient Map.
- Video → Use color wheels for shadows/midtones/highlights.

### Beginner mistake

- Over-saturating colors.

### Pro tip

- Reduce saturation slightly for more professional look.

---------------------------------------------

## 9. Contrast Control

### What it is

- Contrast = difference between light and dark.

### Why it matters

- High contrast → Dramatic, bold.
- Low contrast → Soft, calm.

### How to use it

- Photography → Add contrast for punch.
- Product → Enough contrast to show shape clearly.
- Social → Higher contrast grabs attention.
- Cinematic → Control contrast for mood.

### Editing tip

- Use contrast slider carefully.
- Use tone curve for more control.

### Beginner mistake

- Too much contrast = crushed blacks.

### Pro tip

- Add contrast in shadows for depth, not just overall.

---------------------------------------------

## 10. Light Direction

### What it is

- Light direction = Where the light is coming from.

### Why it matters

- Light direction creates mood and shape.

### How to use it

Light direction creates shape and drama.

- Front light → Flat
- Side light → Depth
- Back light → Glow / cinematic

### How to use it

- Photography → Use window light from side.
- Product → Side light shows texture.
- Social → Avoid harsh overhead light.
- Cinematic → Backlight for emotional scenes.

### Editing tip

- Use dodge & burn to enhance light direction.

### Beginner mistake

- Using only front light.

### Pro tip

- Side light makes products look premium.

---------------------------------------------

## 11. Shadow Realism

### What it is

- Shadows should look natural, not fake.

### Why it matters

- Fake shadows instantly look edited and cheap.

### How to use it

- Product → Add soft shadow under product.
- Photography → Keep natural shadow direction.
- Social → Avoid floating objects.
- Cinematic → Hard shadows for drama.

### Editing tip

Photoshop → Multiply layer + blur for natural shadow.

### Beginner mistake

Shadow too dark or wrong direction.

### Pro tip

Shadows are never pure black. Keep them slightly soft.

---------------------------------------------

## 12. Visual Hierarchy

### What it is

- Order in which people see things.

- Big → Medium → Small.

### Why it matters

- If everything screams, nothing stands out.

### How to use it

- Product → Product first, text second.
- Social → Headline big, details small.
- Cinematic → Subject brighter than background.

### Editing tip

- Increase brightness or contrast on main subject.

### Beginner mistake

Same font size everywhere.

### Pro tip

One clear focal point per frame.

---------------------------------------------

## 13. Typography Basics

### What it is

- How text is designed and placed.

### Why it matters

- Bad typography kills professional look.

### How to use it

- Use 1–2 fonts max.
- Keep spacing clean.
- Don’t stretch fonts.

### Editing tip

- Increase letter spacing slightly for premium feel.

### Beginner mistake

- Too many fonts.

### Pro tip

- Simple fonts often look more expensive.

---------------------------------------------

## 14. Color Psychology

### What it is

- How design makes people feel about a brand.

### Why it matters

- People buy emotion, not just product.

### How to use it

- Black & gold → Luxury
- Bright colors → Fun
- Blue → Trust
- Minimal design → Premium

### Editing tip

- Keep consistent colors, style, and mood across posts.

### Beginner mistake

- Changing style every post.

### Pro tip
