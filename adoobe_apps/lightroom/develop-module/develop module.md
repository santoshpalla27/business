## LIGHTROOM CLASSIC — DEVELOP MODULE

### What Is the Develop Module?

#### Simple Explanation

***Develop = Where you actually edit the photo.***

This is where:

- Exposure is corrected
- Colors are balanced
- Skin tones are fixed
- Mood is created



***Technical Explanation***

The Develop module is a non-destructive RAW processing engine built on Adobe Camera Raw (ACR).

It:

- Edits RAW sensor data
- Preserves dynamic range
- Applies parametric adjustments
- Stores only instructions (not pixel edits)
