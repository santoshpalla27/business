# RIGHT PANEL (The Editing Engine)

This is the heart of Develop.


## 1. Histogram (Top Panel)

***What It Is (Simple)***

A graph showing brightness distribution.

- Left = Dark
- Right = Bright
- Top = Amount of pixels

### Technical

RGB luminance histogram representing tonal range.

***Why It Matters***

- Detect clipped highlights
- Detect crushed shadows
- Balance exposure scientifically

***Professional Tip***

Press J → Shows clipping warning (red = blown highlights, blue = crushed shadows).

Never rely only on your eyes. Use histogram + eyes.



## 2. Toolbar Icons (Just Below Histogram)

You see small icons under histogram:

- Crop
- Spot Removal
- Red Eye
- Masking
- Healing
- etc.

These are local adjustment tools.

Shortcuts:

- R → Crop
- Q → Spot Removal
- Shift + W → Masking

***Rule: Global edits first → local edits later.***

## 3. Basic Panel

This is the foundation.

If Basic is wrong, everything else collapses.

### Inside Basic Panel:

#### Profile

- Choose color science interpretation.
- Do this first.


#### White Balance (Temp + Tint)

- Fix color cast before exposure adjustments.

***Wedding rule:***
Skin tone must look natural before anything else.

#### Exposure

- Controls midtones.
- Set subject brightness here.

#### Contrast

- Adds separation between light & dark.
- Don’t increase until whites/blacks are set.

#### Highlights

- Recover bright areas (sky, dress).

#### Shadows

- Lift dark areas carefully.
- Too much = flat image.

#### Whites / Blacks

- Sets tonal anchor points.
- Hold Alt while dragging to see clipping.
- This is professional dynamic range control.

#### Texture

- Fine detail enhancer.
- Portrait safe.

#### Clarity

- Midtone contrast.
- Use carefully on skin.

#### Dehaze

- Removes haze or adds depth.
- Overuse = dirty colors.

#### Vibrance

- Smart saturation boost.
- Preferred over Saturation.

#### Saturation

- Global color boost.
- Use very lightly.


## 4. Tone Curve

Advanced contrast control.

Two types:

- Parametric
- Point Curve

Professional Use:
- Add subtle S-curve for depth.

Used in:
- Commercial, cinematic, product work.

Do not create extreme bends.



## 5. Color Mixer (HSL)

- Hue – changes color tone
- Saturation – intensity
- Luminance – brightness

Used for:

- Fixing skin tone
- Enhancing sky
- Adjusting product color

Pro Example:

- If skin too orange:
- Reduce Orange Saturation slightly.
- Increase Orange Luminance slightly.


## 6. Color Grading

Three wheels:

- Shadows
- Midtones
- Highlights

Used for mood creation.

Cinematic Look:
- Cool shadows + warm highlights.

Keep saturation subtle.
Balance slider controls influence.



## 7. Detail Panel

Sharpening + Noise Reduction.

### Sharpening

- Amount
- Radius
- Detail
- Masking (hold Alt)

Masking prevents skin sharpening.

Portrait rule:
Masking 70–90.

### Noise Reduction

- Luminance → grain removal
- Color → color noise removal

Don’t overdo luminance. It kills detail.



## 8. Lens Corrections

Always turn on:
✔ Remove Chromatic Aberration
✔ Enable Profile Corrections

Fixes:

- Distortion
- Vignetting
- Color fringing

Professional workflow:
Enable this at start.


## 9. Transform

Perspective correction.

Used for:

- Buildings
- Architecture
- Real estate

Use:
- Auto / Guided Upright.

Don’t use for portraits unless necessary.


## 10. Lens Blur

New AI-based background blur tool.

Used for:
- Simulated depth of field.

Professional Advice:
- Use only when necessary.
- Overuse looks fake.


## 11. Effects

- Post-Crop Vignette → Focus subject
- Grain → Film look

Professional rule:
- Subtle, not obvious.


## 12. Calibration (Advanced)

Adjusts RGB primaries.

Used for:
- Deep color science tweaks.
- Cinematic base tones.

Beginners:
- Avoid until comfortable with HSL & grading.
