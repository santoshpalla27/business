# RIGHT PANEL (The Editing Engine)

This is the heart of Develop.


## 1. Histogram (Top Panel)

***What It Is (Simple)***

A graph showing brightness distribution.

- Left = Dark
- Right = Bright
- Top = Amount of pixels

### Technical

RGB luminance histogram representing tonal range.

***Why It Matters***

- Detect clipped highlights
- Detect crushed shadows
- Balance exposure scientifically

***Professional Tip***

Press J → Shows clipping warning (red = blown highlights, blue = crushed shadows).

Never rely only on your eyes. Use histogram + eyes.



## 2. Toolbar Icons (Just Below Histogram)

You see small icons under histogram:

- Crop
- Spot Removal
- Red Eye
- Masking
- Healing
- etc.

These are local adjustment tools.

Shortcuts:

- R → Crop
- Q → Spot Removal
- Shift + W → Masking

***Rule: Global edits first → local edits later.***

## 3. Basic Panel

This is the foundation.

If Basic is wrong, everything else collapses.

### Inside Basic Panel:


#### Profile

Choose color science interpretation.
Do this first.

#### White Balance (Temp + Tint)

Fix color cast before exposure adjustments.

***Wedding rule:***
Skin tone must look natural before anything else.

#### Exposure

Controls midtones.

Set subject brightness here.

#### Contrast

Adds separation between light & dark.

Don’t increase until whites/blacks are set.

#### Highlights

Recover bright areas (sky, dress).

#### Shadows

Lift dark areas carefully.

Too much = flat image.

#### Whites / Blacks

Sets tonal anchor points.

Hold Alt while dragging to see clipping.

This is professional dynamic range control.

#### Texture

Fine detail enhancer.

Portrait safe.

#### Clarity

Midtone contrast.
Use carefully on skin.

#### Dehaze

Overuse = dirty colors.

#### Vibrance

#### Saturation

Global color boost.
Use very lightly.


## Tone Curve

Advanced contrast control.

Two types:
