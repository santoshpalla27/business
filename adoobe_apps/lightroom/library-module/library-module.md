# LIBRARY MODULE

Library = Your photo control room.

You do NOT edit deeply here.
You import, organize, select, rate, and manage photos here.

Think of it as:

"Sorting and management stage before editing."



### Technical explanation:-

The Library module is a Digital Asset Management (DAM) system.

It handles:

- File organization
- Metadata
- Rating & selection
- Batch tagging
- Smart collections
- Catalog structure

Lightroom Classic stores:

- File location
- Preview
- Editing instructions
- Metadata :- Inside a .lrcat catalog file



## Library Module Layout (Main Components)

Library Module Layout (Main Components):

1. Left Panel (Filters)
2. Main Grid (Thumbnails)
3. Right Panel (Information & Control)


### The Professional Workflow (Library Stage)

#### Here is real-world workflow (Wedding Example):

1. Import
2. Build Smart Previews
3. Cull Images
4. Rate & Flag
5. Create Collections
6. Backup Catalog

***Never start editing without proper culling.***



### Culling System (Industry Standard)

This is how professionals select images.

#### Flags

P = Pick
X = Reject
U = Unflag

Step 1:
Go through entire shoot quickly.
Mark bad ones as X.

Step 2:
Filter → Show Rejected → Delete.


#### Star Rating System

1 star → Backup
2 star → Average
3 star → Good
4 star → Very Good
5 star → Portfolio

***Shortcut: 1–5 keys***


#### Color Labels

6 = Red
7 = Yellow
8 = Green
9 = Blue

Professional Usage Example:

Red → Needs retouch
Green → Album selected
Blue → Delivered



### Import Settings (Very Important)

When importing:

Choose:

- Copy as DNG
- Copy
- Move
- Add

#### Professional Rule: Never use “Move” unless organized system.

#### Recommended: Copy → Rename → Add metadata preset → Build Standard Previews


### Common Beginner Mistakes

❌ Editing without culling
❌ Not using collections
❌ Not adding metadata
❌ Deleting files from Finder instead of Lightroom
❌ Ignoring backup

### Professional Library Workflow Template

#### After Every Shoot:

- Import with metadata preset
- Rename files (ClientName_Date_Sequence)
- Build previews
- Cull using X first
- Rate best using 4 stars
- Create Collection for final selects
- Backup catalog
