## 4. Collections

Folder = physical location
Collection = virtual grouping

One wedding shoot → 2000 images in folder
Create collections:

- Ceremony
- Reception
- Couple Portraits
- Album Selects

### Smart Collections (Very Powerful)

Auto filter images based on rules.

### Example:
Rating ≥ 4 stars
Camera = Sony
ISO > 1600

Lightroom auto groups them. 

### Professional use:
Wedding photographers use Smart Collections to:

- Separate high ISO images (noise correction needed)
- Separate lens types
- Separate color labels
