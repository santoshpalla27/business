 # lightroom cc vs lightroom classic

 lightroom cc is a cloud based photo editing software 

 this is a cloud based app can be used on mobile or web or pc and everything is synced across all devices and backed up to the cloud 

 lightroom classic is a desktop based photo editing software
 this is a local desktop app and everything is stored on the local desktop and not backed up to the cloud and is complex to learn and powerfull tool


 ## both have similar ui and almost same features 

 - but use cc if you want to edit photos on the go and have a simple interface and dont want to worry about storage 

 - use classic if you want more features and more control over your photos and dont  mind the complex interface and storage issues

###      1. What is Lightroom Classic?

Lightroom Classic is a non-destructive RAW photo workflow software designed for:

- Professional photo management
- Color grading
- Batch processing
- Print preparation

## It is different from:

- Adobe Photoshop → pixel-level manipulation

- Adobe Lightroom → cloud-focused simplified version

**Ex:-** Lightroom Classic = Catalog-based professional workflow system


## 2. Core Architecture (Very Important)

### Lightroom is built on 3 main pillars:

1. Catalog (.lrcat file)

- Database of all edits
- Stores metadata
- Does NOT store original photos

2. Original Files

- RAW / JPEG stored on disk
- Lightroom references them

3. Preview Files

- Smart previews for performance
- Used when original drive disconnected

⚠️ If catalog is deleted → edits are gone (unless XMP enabled)
