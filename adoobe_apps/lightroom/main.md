 ## lightroom cc vs lightroom classic

 lightroom cc is a cloud based photo editing software 

 this is a cloud based app can be used on mobile or web or pc and everything is synced across all devices and backed up to the cloud 

 lightroom classic is a desktop based photo editing software
 this is a local desktop app and everything is stored on the local desktop and not backed up to the cloud and is complex to learn and powerfull tool


both have similar ui and almost same features 

but use cc if you want to edit photos on the go and have a simple interface and dont want to worry about storage 

use classic if you want more features and more control over your photos and dont mind the complex interface and storage issues
