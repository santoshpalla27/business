# Contextual Task Bar

## The Contextual Task Bar is a smart floating panel that changes automatically based on what you are doing.

- Select a subject → it shows Remove Background / Select Subject
- Add text → it shows Font, Size, Color, Alignment
- Draw a shape → it shows Fill, Stroke, Radius
- Make a selection → it shows Mask / Fill / Adjust

### Think of it as:

- Photoshop suggesting your next logical step.
- Instead of searching panels, Photoshop brings relevant actions near your canvas.

### You can enable/disable it from:

- Window → Contextual Task Bar
