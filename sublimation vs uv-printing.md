# Core Difference (One-Line Summary)


sublimation we use ink printed on paper and heat pressed to transfer the image on the material (heat-based, limited materials)

uv priting we directly print on the material using uv ink and cure it using uv light (UV-cured, almost any material)

## Sublimation
- Uses sublimation ink + heat press
- Ink turns into gas and bonds with polyester or polymer coating
- No ink layer → zero texture

**Result:** Soft, permanent, breathable print

## UV Printing (UV-cured ink)
- Ink printed directly on surface
- Instantly cured using UV light
- Ink forms a raised, solid layer

**Result:** Sharp, vibrant, premium finish
