# Laser Technologies

## 1. CO₂ Laser (Non-Metals – Cutting & Engraving)

A CO₂ laser uses a gas mixture (carbon dioxide) and produces a 10.6 μm wavelength, which is strongly absorbed by non-metal materials.

### What it works on

- ✔️ Wood
- ✔️ MDF / plywood
- ✔️ Acrylic (very important)
- ✔️ Leather
- ✔️ Rubber
- ✔️ Fabric
- ✔️ Paper
- ✔️ Glass (engraving only)

❌ Bare metals (cannot cut or engrave directly)

### What it can do

- Cutting → wood, acrylic, MDF, fabric

- Engraving → wood, acrylic, leather, glass

### Pros

- ✅ Clean cuts (no smoke)
- ✅ No heat-affected zone
- ✅ High precision
- ✅ Can engrave

### Cons

- ❌ Not for metals
- ❌ Slower than fiber
- ❌ Higher cost
- ❌ Limited to non-metals

### CO₂ Laser – Real-World Examples

- Acrylic photo frames
- Wooden name boards
- MDF wall décor
- Leather wallets & keychains
- Rubber stamps
- Glass engraving (frosted effect)

### Cost & usage

- 💰 Low–Medium machine cost
- 🏭 Best for gifting, signage, décor, craft businesses


## 2. Fiber Laser (Metals Only – Marking & Engraving)  

A fiber laser uses a fiber optic cable to deliver a high-intensity beam of light, which is focused to a very small spot to create heat and cut or engrave materials.

A fiber laser uses a solid-state fiber optic source with a 1.064 μm wavelength, which is perfectly absorbed by metals.

### What it works on

- ✔️ Stainless steel
- ✔️ Aluminum
- ✔️ Brass
- ✔️ Copper
- ✔️ Gold & silver
- ✔️ Mild steel
- ✔️ Titanium

❌ Wood, acrylic, glass, leather (won’t work)

### What it can do

- Permanent marking
- Deep engraving
- Annealing (color marking on steel)

❌ Cutting (unless very high-power industrial fiber lasers)


### Fiber Laser – Real-World Examples

- Metal business cards
- Stainless steel bottles & tumblers
- Brass nameplates
- Industrial part serial numbers
- Jewelry engraving
- QR codes on metal tools


### Why fiber laser is special

- Marking is permanent
- No ink, no consumables
- Extremely fast & precise


### Cost & usage

- 💰 Medium–High machine cost
- 🏭 Best for metal marking & industrial use



## 3. UV Laser (Cold Laser – Soft Materials & Marking)

A UV laser works at a 355 nm wavelength and is known as a cold laser because it produces minimal heat.

### What it works on

- ✔️ Plastics
- ✔️ Acrylic
- ✔️ Glass
- ✔️ Soft metals (marking only)
- ✔️ PCB boards
- ✔️ Medical materials


### What it can do

- High-precision marking
- Micro-engraving
- No burning, no melting

❌ Cutting (generally not used for cutting)


### UV Laser – Real-World Examples

- Cosmetic packaging marking
- Medicine bottles
- Plastic pens & electronics
- Glass perfume bottles
- Mobile phone components
- PCB QR codes



### Why UV laser is premium

- No heat damage
- Extremely fine details
- Clean, white marking on plastics

### Cost & usage

- 💰 Very high machine cost
- 🏭 Medical, electronics, premium branding



## 4. Galvo Laser (High-Speed Marking System)

Galvo is NOT a laser type
It is a motion system that uses fast mirrors to direct the laser beam.

👉 Galvo systems can be:

- CO₂ Galvo
- Fiber Galvo
- UV Galvo

### What Galvo does

- Extremely fast marking
- Very high accuracy
- Best for logos, serial numbers, QR codes

**Materials (depends on laser source)**

- CO₂ Galvo → non-metals
- Fiber Galvo → metals
- UV Galvo → plastics & glass

### Galvo Laser – Real-World Examples

- High-speed logo engraving
- Batch marking on gifts
- Industrial serial number marking
- QR code engraving
- Fast acrylic engraving (CO₂ galvo)

### Why businesses use Galvo

- Faster than gantry lasers
- Ideal for mass production
- Minimal movement, high precision



## Business Selection Guide

- Acrylic frames & wooden gifts → CO₂ laser   
- Metal bottles, plates, jewelry → Fiber laser
- Plastic & cosmetic packaging → UV laser
- High-speed batch marking → Galvo system
