materials :- frames , photo paper or Translucent backlit film for led frames , led lights(for backlit frames)

first the image is printed on the paper and then it is laminated and then it is mounted on the frame

# making process :- 

## Standard Photo Frame Making Process

### ✅ Step 1 – Photo Printing

Image is printed using:

- Inkjet printer (most common)
- Laser printer (less common for photos)

👉 This creates the base photo print.


### ✅ Step 2 – Lamination (Protection Layer)

Now the photo is laminated.

**Types of lamination**

- Matte lamination
- Gloss lamination
- Glitter lamination
- Texture lamination

**Why lamination is done**

- ✔ Protects photo from moisture
- ✔ Prevents scratches
- ✔ Improves appearance
- ✔ Increases durability

👉 Lamination is done using a hot or cold lamination machine


### Step 3 – Mounting on MDF / Foam Board

After lamination, the print is mounted.

**Process**

- Adhesive applied to board
- Laminated photo pasted onto board
- Roller press removes air bubbles
- Excess edges trimmed

👉 This step makes photo strong and flat.


### Step 4 – Framing

Now the mounted board is placed inside the frame.

**Frame includes:**

- Outer frame (wood / fiber / metal)
- Back support board
- Hanging hook or stand

### ✅ Step 5 – Final Finishing

- Cleaning surface
- Packaging
- Quality check

### 🧠 Correct Order (Very Important)

- 👉 Printing
- 👉 Lamination
- 👉 Mounting on MDF / Foam board
- 👉 Framing
- 👉 Packaging


### When Lamination May Be Skipped

Some frame types do NOT require lamination:

- ✔ Canvas oil painting
  (Canvas itself is durable)

- ✔ Acrylic UV printing
  (Print directly on acrylic)

- ✔ LED backlit frames
  (Use backlit film instead)

## What MDF is

MDF stands for Medium Density Fiberboard.

It is made by:
- Compressing wood fibers
- Mixing them with resin
- Pressing them into flat boards

👉 It looks like smooth engineered wood.

**Why MDF is used in photo frames**

- Very strong & rigid
- Does not bend easily
- Gives premium feel
- Long-lasting support
- Good for large frames

**Thickness normally used**

- 2 mm
- 3 mm
- 5 mm
- 8 mm (large frames)


## What Foam Board is

Foam board is made of:
- A light foam layer inside
- Paper or plastic sheet on both sides

👉 Think of it as lightweight sandwich board.

**Why Foam Board is used**

- Very lightweight
- Easy to cut
- Smooth mounting surface
- Budget friendly
- Good for temporary or medium-life frames


**Where Foam board mounting is used**

- Posters
