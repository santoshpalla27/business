for board we use wood as the base and cut the wood in the required shape and size.  

then we can use acrylic-wood on top of the  base wood and 

we can make the required design on the acrylic-wood using uv printer and cut and paste on the base wood (laser cutting wood to create design)


## examples 

in this example:

![Milky White Acrylic and base wood designed 1](Milky%20White%20Acrylic%20and%20base%20wood%20desined-1.webp)

![Milky White Acrylic and base wood designed](Milky%20White%20Acrylic%20and%20base%20wood%20desined.webp)


we take mliky white acrylic and cut it in the shape of the design using laser cutting.  

then we print the design on the acrylic using uv printer.  

then we make the base wood in the required shape and size.  

then we paste the acrylic-wood design of letters on the base wood.

and then we mount the whole design with wood design being elevated from the base wood.
