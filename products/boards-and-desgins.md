for board we use wood as the base and cut the wood in the required shape and size.  

then we can use acrylic-wood on top of the  base wood and 

we can make the required design on the acrylic-wood using uv printer and cut and paste on the base wood (laser cutting wood to create design)


## examples 

in this example:

![Milky White Acrylic and base wood designed](Milky%20White%20Acrylic%20and%20base%20wood%20desined.webp)


we take mliky white acrylic and cut it in the shape of the design using laser cutting.  

then we print the design on the acrylic using uv printer.  

then we make the base wood in the required shape and size using laser cutting.  

then we paste the acrylic-wood design of letters on the base wood using glue.  

and then we mount the whole design with wood design being elevated from the base wood using the wood pieces to keep it elevated from the base wood and give space for the leafs.

first we cut the base wood according to the design using laser cutting.  

we print the photos of the acrylic wood using sublimation. and then we paste the acrylic wood on the base wood using glue.   

we also make the latters using acyrlic or normal by laser cutting with good mm to be evalted and then paste the acrylic wood on the base wood using glue.
