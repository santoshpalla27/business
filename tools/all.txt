             Photoshop

Photoshop is a raster-based image editing tool. It works with pixels.

Common real-world uses

Photo editing & retouching (lighting, color, skin, object removal)

Graphic design (posters, banners, flyers)

Social media creatives (Instagram posts, YouTube thumbnails, ads)

Marketing assets (ad creatives, website banners)

Mockups (product previews, app screens on devices)

👉 Rule of thumb:

If it’s pixel-based and visual, Photoshop is usually the right tool.


              Raster vs Vector (CRITICAL CONCEPT)

Raster (Photoshop)

Made of pixels
Quality depends on resolution
Enlarging causes blur / pixelation
Examples: Photos, scanned images, textures

Vector (Illustrator)

Made of paths & mathematical shapes
Infinitely scalable
No quality loss at any size

Examples: Logos, icons, illustrations   


Examples: Logos, icons, illustrations

| Tool        | Type   | Best For                |
| ----------- | ------ | ----------------------- |
| Photoshop   | Raster | Photos, ads, thumbnails |
| Illustrator | Vector | Logos, icons, branding  |

Golden rule:

Photoshop ≠ Logo design
Illustrator ≠ Photo editing

                             Image Basics (Must-Know Concepts)

🔹 Pixels & Canvas Size

Pixel = smallest unit of an image
Canvas size = width × height (e.g., 1920 × 1080 px)

Example:

Instagram post → 1080 × 1080 px
YouTube thumbnail → 1280 × 720 px

👉 Bigger canvas = more pixels = more detail (but larger file size)



🔹 Resolution (DPI / PPI)

72 DPI → Screens (web, mobile, social media)

300 DPI → Print (posters, brochures, magazines)

👉 DPI does NOT matter for screens
👉 DPI DOES matter for print

Common beginner mistake:
Using 72 DPI for print → blurry output



🔹 RGB vs CMYK

| Mode | Used For | Color Type  |
| ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| RGB  | Screens  | Light-based |
| CMYK | Printing | Ink-based   |


Screens glow → RGB

Printers use ink → CMYK

👉 Design for screen → RGB
👉 Design for print → CMYK


🔹 File Formats (When to Use What)

| Format | Best For | Key Feature |
| ------ | -------- | ----------- |
| JPEG   | Photos   | Small file size |
| PNG    | Graphics | Transparency |
| GIF    | Animation| Simple loops |
| TIFF   | Print    | High quality |
| SVG    | Vector   | Scalable |

👉 JPEG = photos (lossy)
👉 PNG = graphics (lossless

| Format   | Use Case                                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **JPG**  | Photos, web images (small size, no transparency) |
| **PNG**  | Transparency, logos, UI assets                   |
| **PSD**  | Photoshop working file (layers preserved)        |
| **TIFF** | High-quality print, publishing                   |
| **WebP** | Modern web images (smaller + good quality)       |


👉 Always keep your PSD (psd - editable file)
Exports are disposable, PSD is gold.
