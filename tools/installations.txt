Main UXP folders (system-wide)

This is the most common one:

/Library/Application Support/Adobe/UXP


To get there quickly:

Open Finder

Click Go in the menu bar

Hold Option (⌥) → Library appears

Navigate to:

Application Support → Adobe → UXP

User-specific UXP folder

Some plugins/extensions live here:

(~ = your home folder)



Same process for com.adobe.cai.uxp.panel. Go to Required, UXP, remove “com.adobe.cai.uxp.panel” and paste the cracked one.



Add these strings on your Host (I recommend to use this app for an easy process: iHosts https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ihosts-etc-hosts-editor/id1102004240?mt=12)

https://a.dove.isdumb.one/list.txt.   -- this has all the hosts 

Block as well with your personal firewall.

IF you get a piracy nag, use the software with your net off. 
Sorry guys, Adobe is a pain of ass for Mac.
