          Photoshop Interface (Your Control Panel)

Think of Photoshop like a cockpit. Once you know what each panel does, panic disappears.

Speed and confidence come from UI familiarity.

🔹 Toolbar (Left Side)

What it is:
The vertical strip of tools on the left.

What it contains:
Move Tool (V)
Selection tools (Marquee, Lasso)
Crop Tool

Small triangle on tools = more tools hidden underneath
You use one tool at a time, so choosing the right tool matters

👉 Why it matters:

Wrong tool = frustration. Right tool = control.


similar tools are grouped together in the toolbar 
 
to select the hidden tools we have to click and hold the tool and select the required tool from the dropdown menu 


                      move tool (V)
movetool :- 

this is used to move the selected layers in the canvas 

once you select the move tool you can see the options bar will change according to the move tool 

for better control Deselect the auto select option in the options bar this help to move only the laser selected

======================================================================================

🔹 menu bar (top)

The Menu Bar sits at the very top of Photoshop and controls global actions (file, image, layers, selections, view).

Menus (left → right):
File | Edit | Image | Layer | Type | Select | Filter | View | Window | Help


--------------------------------------------------------

1. File Menu — File & Project Control

Purpose: Creating, opening, saving, exporting files.

Important options (Beginner must-know)

New → Create a new document
Open → Open existing image
Save → Save working file (PSD)
Save As → Save copy / change format
Export → Export As → JPG, PNG, WebP (for web/social)
Close → Close file

👉 Professional habit

---------------------------------------------------------

2. Edit Menu — Undo, Preferences & Fixes

Purpose: Correcting actions and setting behavior.
Important options

===============================================================================

          panels 

the right side section of the interface is the panels  . you can delete add or change the panels as per your need and can delete or minimize the panels as per your need 

you can add panels from the window menu in the top section of the interface 

you can reset workspace or create your own workspace with your panels 


after editing or doing some changes in the workspace you can go the menu of window and click on workspace and click on reset workspace to reset the workspace to the saved state  



🔹 Layers Panel (MOST IMPORTANT PANEL)

What it is:

A stack of everything in your design. 
Think of layers like transparent sheets stacked on top of each other.

ex:- there can a backgound layer with background image and there can be a text layer with text on top of the background layer  and a person layer with person image on top of the text layer  

Core concepts:

Each image, text, or shape = separate layer
Top layer covers layers below

You can:

Hide 👁️
Lock 🔒
Reorder ⬆️⬇️
Rename (VERY important habit)

the top most layer with be at the top in the canvas and the bottom most layer will be at the backgound in the canvas . this order continues for all the layers  

👉 Why it matters:

Non-destructive editing
Easy changes
Professional workflow

❌ Beginners who ignore layers → redo work
✅ Professionals live inside the Layers panel



🔹 Properties Panel

What it is:

Shows editable settings for the selected layer or tool.

Examples:

Text layer → font, spacing, color
Shape layer → fill, stroke, corner radius
Adjustment layer → brightness, contrast, curves

👉 Why it matters:
You don’t hunt menus—Photoshop shows you what’s relevant automatically.
in the panel it records all the actions we are making by selecting the step we can undo or redo the actions 

ctl + z to undo 
ctl + shift + z to redo 

cmd + z to undo 
cmd + shift + z to redo 



🔹 History Panel (Your Safety Net)

What it is:
A timeline of your actions.

You can:

Step backward multiple actions
Revert mistakes without panic

Limit:

History resets when file closes (unless using snapshots)

👉 Why it matters:
Confidence comes from knowing nothing is permanent.




🔹 Workspace Presets

What it is:
Pre-arranged layouts of panels for different tasks.

Common presets:

Essentials (default)
Photography
Graphic and Web
Motion
Painting

You can also:

Rearrange panels
Save your own workspace

👉 Why it matters:
Right workspace = faster work, less clutter, less confusion.





=============================================================================

             the canvas section 


this is the section where we have the file or image or canvas or design we are working on  


we can select multiple image in Canvas they will show as tabs 

we can pull the tabs out of the canvas section and place them anywhere in the interface  of can arrage them back by going to menu arrage and consolidate all to tabs 

we can also compare the images side by side by going to menu arrage and compare all windows side by side  


we can set the custom color to the canvas by right click on the canvas and select the background color or the custom color helpfull for the beginners and social media
ex:- how a thumbnail(edited image) looks on the youtube interface like the web color 



drag and drop and image to the tab then it will be a new image but if you drag and drop the image to the canvas it will be a new layer 





===========================================================================

                           Transform Tool

Transform lets you change the size, rotation, shape, and perspective of a layer or selection.

Shortcut: Ctrl + T (Windows) / Cmd + T (Mac)

This is called Free Transform.

👉 If you know Transform well, layouts become fast and clean.
