# different types of prints 

1. inkjet print ( liquid ink )
2. laser jet ( powder ink )
3. screen print / offset print ( paint ink )



## 1. Inkjet Printing (Liquid Ink Printing)

Inkjet printing uses liquid ink sprayed in microscopic droplets onto paper or media through a printhead.

**Ink type**

- Dye ink (bright colors, photo quality)
- Pigment ink (water-resistant, longer life)
- Sublimation ink (for heat transfer printing)

**How it works**

- Digital image sent to printer
- Printhead sprays tiny ink droplets
- Ink absorbs into or coats the media surface
- Ink dries naturally (air or heat-assisted)

**Print quality**

- ⭐ Excellent photo quality
- ⭐ Smooth color gradients
- ⭐ High detail & sharpness

**Materials it can print on**

- Photo paper (glossy, matte, luster)
- Canvas
- Backlit film
- Sublimation paper
- Art papers

**Best used for**

- Photo frames
- Canvas oil paintings
- LED backlit films

## 2. Laser Printing (LaserJet / Toner Printing – Powder Ink)

Laser printing uses dry powder ink (toner) fused onto paper using heat and pressure.

**Ink type**
- Toner powder (plastic + pigment)

**How it works**

- Laser creates electrostatic image on drum
- Toner powder sticks to charged areas
- Paper passes through heated fuser
- Toner melts and bonds to paper

### Cons

- ❌ Not ideal for photos
- ❌ Limited color depth
- ❌ Heat-sensitive media issues
- ❌ Higher machine cost

### Cost & durability

- 💰 Low cost per print (bulk jobs)
- 🛡️ High durability for documents

Uses thick paint-like inks transferred to material via screens (screen printing) or plates & rollers (offset printing).

### 🔹 Screen Printing

**How it works**

### Cons

- ❌ High setup cost
- ❌ Not suitable for customization
- ❌ Not photo-realistic
