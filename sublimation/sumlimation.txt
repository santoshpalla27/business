Sublimation :- Sublimation printing is a digital printing process where special ink is converted directly from a solid to a gas (without becoming liquid) using heat, and that gas bonds permanently with a material—usually polyester fabric or polymer-coated surfaces.

A heat-based printing process where ink becomes gas and permanently bonds with polyester or polymer-coated surfaces.

Design creation
 You create a design using graphic software (Photoshop, Illustrator, etc.).

Print on sublimation paper
 The design is printed using sublimation ink onto sublimation transfer paper (not regular paper).

Heat + pressure applied
 A heat press (≈180–205 °C) presses the paper onto the product.

Ink sublimates
 The ink turns into gas and penetrates the surface.

Permanent bonding
The ink becomes part of the material itself—no layer, no peeling.
