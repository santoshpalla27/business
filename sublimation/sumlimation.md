sublimation is when we print on a paper using sublimation ink and then we heat press it on a material.  

any material can be used for sublimation printing but it should be coated with a polymer coating.  

materials :- papers (sublimation papers , Translucent backlit film , etc) , polymer coated items (mugs, phone cases, metal photo panels, mouse pads, etc) , 


# Sublimation & Backlit Printing Papers

## 1. Sublimation Transfer Paper

This is the standard medium used to print your design before heat-press transfer onto a substrate (ceramic mug, metal, coated frame surface, etc.). Sublimation paper holds dye sublimation ink and releases it under heat & pressure so it permanently bonds to polyester or specially coated hard surfaces.

## 2. LED Backlit Printable Film / Paper

If you’re making LED backlit photo frames (translucent prints that look bright when illuminated), you need a translucent backlit film, not regular sublimation paper. This is semi-transparent film designed for inkjet or laser printers and works with LED lightboxes. These films hold ink but allow light to pass through for that glowing effect.

material :- Translucent backlit film and LED lightbox and Inkjet printer


## Sublimation

Sublimation printing is a digital printing process where special ink is converted directly from a solid to a gas (without becoming liquid) using heat, and that gas bonds permanently with a material—usually polyester fabric or polymer-coated surfaces.

A heat-based printing process where ink becomes gas and permanently bonds with polyester or polymer-coated surfaces.

### Design creation
You create a design using graphic software (Photoshop, Illustrator, etc.).

### Print on sublimation paper
The design is printed using sublimation ink onto sublimation transfer paper (not regular paper).

### Heat + pressure applied
A heat press (≈180–205 °C) presses the paper onto the product.

### Ink sublimates
The ink turns into gas and penetrates the surface.

### Permanent bonding
The ink becomes part of the material itself—no layer, no peeling.

### What materials work with sublimation?

✅ **Works best on**
- Polyester fabrics (100% polyester is ideal)
- Polymer-coated items, such as:
- Mugs
- Phone cases
- Metal photo panels
- Mouse pads

❌ **Does NOT work well on**
- 100% cotton
- Dark-colored fabrics (ink is transparent)
- Uncoated hard surfaces

### Key characteristics :- 

- Ink feel :- No texture  (inks become part of fabric)
- Durability :- Extremely high (won’t crack, peel, or fade easily)
- Wash resistance :- Excellent
- Color quality :- Very vibrant on light surfaces
- Breathability:- Fabric remains breathable

### Common uses :-
- Custom T-shirts & sportswear
- Photo mugs
- Promotional items
- Personalized gifts
- Signage and photo panels
