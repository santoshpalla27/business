# Adobe Installation Guide

Install Full or Minimum Adobe Creative Cloud from the Extra folder first.
Minimum ACC Runtime_x86_64 (Intel) or Runtime_ARM64 (ARM) is fine.


## Now Install Adobe Photoshop

### Main UXP folders (system-wide)

This is the most common one:

`/Library/Application Support/Adobe/UXP`


**To get there quickly:**

1. Open Finder
2. Click **Go** in the menu bar
3. Hold Option (⌥) → Library appears
4. Navigate to: `Application Support` → `Adobe` → `UXP`

### User-specific UXP folder

Some plugins/extensions live here:

`~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/UXP`

(~ = your home folder)



Same process for `com.adobe.cai.uxp.panel`. Go to Required, UXP, remove “com.adobe.cai.uxp.panel” and paste the cracked one.



### Host File Modification

Add these strings on your Host (I recommend to use this app for an easy process: iHosts [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ihosts-etc-hosts-editor/id1102004240?mt=12](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ihosts-etc-hosts-editor/id1102004240?mt=12))

[https://a.dove.isdumb.one/list.txt](https://a.dove.isdumb.one/list.txt)   -- this has all the hosts 

Block as well with your personal firewall.

> IF you get a piracy nag, use the software with your net off. 

Sorry guys, Adobe is a pain of ass for Mac.


Enjoy
